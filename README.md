# Python3-windows-installer

This app is like https://github.com/coltonsr77/projects-downloader-P3WS but it will look for a file called "installerready.exe" or "installeready.bat" and it will run one of them

If you want to add "installerready" to your repo get it at:https://github.com/coltonsr77/installerready
